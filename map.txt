1. Enhanced Workflow Development
Users can describe the desired workflow in natural language, and the LLM can translate this description into an executable low-code workflow.
Helps users to write Groovy script snippets required for custom automation tasks within workflows.
Automatically review workflow logic and code to identify potential errors or inefficiencies, readability, suggesting corrections or optimizations.
Recreate the Automation Runbook from the Workflow: Generate detailed automation runbooks based on the developed workflows, ensuring all steps are documented for review and compliance.
2. Standardizing Workflow Actions
To enhance the usability of the Health Restoration Service (HRS), it is important to standardize the workflow actions library. Standardization ensures consistency, reusability, and ease of maintenance.
Actions to be modular and reusable across different workflows.
Documentation for each step, including examples and best practices.
Implement search and filter capabilities to help users quickly find relevant actions.
Quality Assurance: Testing procedures for each action, including unit tests and integration tests.
3. Advanced Workflow Log Analysis and Diagnostics
Parse extensive audit logs and provide concise summaries, highlighting key events, and reasons for failures.
Assist in performing root cause analysis by scanning audit logs and identifying patterns that led to the issue.
Users can query specific aspects of audit logs, such as asking for explanations of certain log entries or requesting detailed breakdowns of execution paths.
4. Log Monitoring
Continuously monitor audit logs in real-time, detecting patterns that might indicate a failure or performance degradation due to platform or some changes in the HRS platform.
Identify trends and recurring issues, helping to proactively address potential problems in workflow.
5. Continuous Improvement and Learning
Identify trends in workflow failures and Production Engineer interactions to inform future updates and enhancements to the HRS Workflows.
6. User Assistance and Support
Interactive Help Systems: Real-time assistance to users developing workflows based on the prompts and guiding them through complex tasks.
Personalized Training: Based on proficiency level, helping them to learn HRS features and answer their queries.
Knowledge Base Generation: Automatically generate and update documentation, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides based on user interactions and enhancements.
7. Containerization and Multi-Tenant Support Implementation
Each user registered as separate tenants and ensure isolation of tenant data to maintain privacy and security. Implement access control mechanisms to access their own audit logs, configs, and workflows.
Use Docker or similar technologies to containerize HRS applications and services, making them portable and easy to manage.
Isolate tenant environments, ensuring that each tenantâ€™s resources are segregated.
Implement resource quotas to allocate appropriate resources to each tenant.
8. Scalability and High Availability 
9. Cloud Support
